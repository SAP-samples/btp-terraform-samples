# Use case: Enhance core ERP business processes with resilient applications on SAP BTP

This script is based on the [GitHub repository for the use case of building resilient BTP apps](https://github.com/SAP-samples/btp-build-resilient-apps/tree/main).

It uses the [Terraform provider for SAP BTP](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/SAP/btp/latest/docs) to setup the necessary BTP infrastructure for that use case.
