# Compliance checks

This folder contains a python script to ensure compliance with very basic naming conventions.

You can either run the script over all folders likes this:
````
python scan_tf.py
````

Or you can check a specific folder like this (fully qualified path needed):
````
python scan_tf.py /workspaces/btp-terraform-samples/released/discovery_center/mission_3680
````

As a result the script will tell you if there are some deviations from the naming conventions.
