# SITBLR DECEMBER 2024 - HandsOn SAP Terraform Provider for SAP BTP

## Goal of this Hands-on üéØ

In this hands-on exercise you will learn how to use the [Terraform Provider for SAP BTP](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/SAP/btp/latest/docs) to provision and manage resources in SAP BTP. The level of the exercises is beginner. You don't need any prior knowledge about Terraform or the Terraform Provider for SAP BTP. We will guide you through the exercises step by step.

## Prerequisites üìù

Make sure that the following prerequisites are met:

- You have an SAP BTP Trial Account. If you don't have one yet, you can get one [here](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/hcp-create-trial-account.html).
- Make sure that your SAP Universal ID is configured correctly. You can find the instructions in [SAP Note 3085908](https://me.sap.com/notes/3085908).
- The Terraform provider does not support SSO or 2FA. Make sure that these options are not enforced for your account.


## Tools üõ†Ô∏è

You can install the required tools locally on your machine. The following tools are required:

- [Terraform CLI](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/install?product_intent=terraform)
- An editor of your choice. We recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) with the [Terraform extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HashiCorp.terraform).


## Exporting environment variables

The last step in the setup is the export of the environment variables that are required to authenticate against the Terraform provider for SAP BTP. For that export the following environment variables:

- Windows:

    ```pwsh
    $env:BTP_USERNAME=<your SAP BTP username>
    $env:BTP_PASSWORD='<your SAP BTP password>'
    ```

- Linux/MacOS/GitHub Codespaces:

    ```bash
    export BTP_USERNAME=<your SAP BTP username>
    export BTP_PASSWORD='<your SAP BTP password>'
    ```

Validate that the values are set via:

- Windows: `$env:BTP_USERNAME` and `$env:BTP_PASSWORD`
- Linux/MacOS/GitHub Codeapses: `echo $BTP_USERNAME` and `echo $BTP_PASSWORD`


## Summary

Your development environment is now ready, and you have all the necessary information to start using the Terraform provider to create and manage an SAP BTP subaccount with Cloud Foundry (CF) resources. This setup provisions the subaccount with a name, subdomain, labels, and user roles. It also enables services like SAP Business Application Studio (BAS) and configures a CF environment with an organization and space. Additionally, user roles, such as space managers and space developers, are assigned to the CF space.
