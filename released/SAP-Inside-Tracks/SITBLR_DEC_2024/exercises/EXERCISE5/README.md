# Exercise 5 - Create a CloudFoundry Space

## Goal of this Exercise ðŸŽ¯

In this exercise you will learn how to use the Terrafomr Provider for CloudFoundry and create a space.

### Step 3: Adjust the provider configuration

As we are using an additional provider we must make Terraform aware of this in the `provider.tf` file. Open the `provider.tf` file and add the following code to the `required_provider` block:

```terraform
cloudfoundry = {
      source  = "cloudfoundry/cloudfoundry"
      version = "1.1.0"
    }
```

To configure the Cloud Foundry provider add the following lines at the end of the file:

```terraform
provider "cloudfoundry" {
  api_url = "https://api.cf.${var.region}-001.hana.ondemand.com"
}
```
Save your changes.

> [!WARNING]
> We assume that the Cloud Foundry environment is deployed to the extension landscape 001. If this is not the case the authentication might fail. In a real-world scenario you would probably have a different boundary of content to the module.

To fulfill all requirements for the authentication against the Cloud Foundry environment you must export the following environment variables:

- Windows:

    ```pwsh
    $env:CF_USER=<your SAP BTP username>
    $env:CF_PASSWORD='<your SAP BTP password>'
    ```

- Linux/MacOS/GitHub Codespaces:

    ```bash
    export CF_USER=<your SAP BTP username>
    export CF_PASSWORD='<your SAP BTP password>'
    ```

> [!NOTE]
> Although we do not use the Cloud Foundry part of the module namely the assignment of users to the organization, Terraform will initialize the Cloud Foundry provider and try to authenticate against the Cloud Foundry environment. This is why we need to define the configuration and provide the credentials.

### Step 3: Apply the changes

As we have a new provider in place, we need to re-initialize the setup to download the required provider and module. Run the following command:

```bash
terraform init
```

The output should look like this:

<img width="600px" src="assets/ex7_1.png" alt="executing terraform init with cloud foundry provider">

> [!NOTE]
> There is also a command parameter called `--upgrade` for the `terraform init` command. This parameter will *upgrade* the provider to the latest version. As we are adding new providers, we do not need to use this parameter.

You know the drill by now:

1. Plan the Terraform configuration to see what will be created:

    ```bash
    terraform plan
    ```

    The output should look like this:

    <img width="600px" src="assets/ex7_2.png" alt="executing terraform plan with cloud foundry">

2. Apply the Terraform configuration to create the environment:

    ```bash
    terraform apply
    ```

    You will be prompted to confirm the creation of the environment. Type `yes` and press `Enter` to continue.

The result should look like this:

<img width="600px" src="assets/ex7_3.png" alt="executing terraform apply with cloud foundry provider">

You can also check that everything is in place via the SAP BTP cockpit. You should see the Cloud Foundry environment in the subaccount:

## Creation of a Cloud Foundry space

As a last task we also want to add a Cloud Foundry space to the Cloud Foundry environment. 

### Step 1: Add the variable to the configuration for Space creation

First we need to add more variable in the `variables.tf` file. Open the `variables.tf` file and add the following code:

```terraform
variable "cf_space_name" {
  type        = string
  description = "The name of the Cloud Foundry space."
  default     = "dev"
}

variable "cf_landscape_label" {
  type        = string
  description = "The region where the project account shall be created in."
  default     = "cf-us10-001"
}

variable "cf_org_name" {
  type        = string
  description = "The name for the Cloud Foundry Org."
  default     = ""
}

variable "cf_org_user" {
  type        = set(string)
  description = "Defines the colleagues who are added to each subaccount as subaccount administrators."
  default     = ["jane.doe@test.com", "john.doe@test.com"]
}

variable "cf_space_managers" {
  type        = list(string)
  description = "The list of Cloud Foundry space managers."
  default     = []
}

variable "cf_space_developers" {
  type        = list(string)
  description = "The list of Cloud Foundry space developers."
  default     = []
}

variable "cf_space_auditors" {
  type        = list(string)
  description = "The list of Cloud Foundry space auditors."
  default     = []
}
```

This allows us to specify the name of the Cloud Foundry space. We also define a default value (`dev`) for the variable. Save the changes.

### Step 2: Cloudfoundry Space Creation and Role Assignments

To trigger the creation of a Cloud Foundry space and space roles, Open the `main.tf` file and add the following code:

```terraform
resource "cloudfoundry_org_role" "my_role" {
  for_each = var.cf_org_user
  username = each.value
  type     = "organization_user"
  org      = btp_subaccount_environment_instance.cloudfoundry.platform_id
}

resource "cloudfoundry_space" "space" {
  name = var.name
  org  = btp_subaccount_environment_instance.cloudfoundry.platform_id
}

resource "cloudfoundry_space_role" "cf_space_managers" {
  for_each = toset(var.cf_space_managers)
  username = each.value
  type     = "space_manager"
  space    = cloudfoundry_space.space.id
  depends_on = [ cloudfoundry_org_role.my_role ]
}

resource "cloudfoundry_space_role" "cf_space_developers" {
  for_each = toset(var.cf_space_developers)
  username = each.value
  type     = "space_developer"
  space    = cloudfoundry_space.space.id
  depends_on = [ cloudfoundry_org_role.my_role ]
}

resource "cloudfoundry_space_role" "cf_space_auditors" {
  for_each = toset(var.cf_space_auditors)
  username = each.value
  type     = "space_auditor"
  space    = cloudfoundry_space.space.id
  depends_on = [ cloudfoundry_org_role.my_role ]
}
```

### Step 3: Add the variables to tfvar file

Now we can add `space developers` and `space managers` to the space we created, Add following variables to your `tfvars` file.

```terraform
cf_org_user   = ["john.doe@test.com"]     
cf_space_developers = ["john.doe@test.com"]
```
Save the changes.

### Step 4: Apply the changes

As we have all prerequisites already in place when it comes to provider configuration and authentication, we can proceed with applying the changes.

1. Plan the Terraform configuration to see what will be created:

    ```bash
    terraform plan
    ```

    The output should look like this:

    <img width="600px" src="assets/ex7_6.png" alt="executing terraform plan for cloud foundry space creation">

2. Apply the Terraform configuration to create the space:

    ```bash
    terraform apply
    ```

    You will be prompted to confirm the creation of the space. Type `yes` and press `Enter` to continue.

The result should look like this:

<img width="600px" src="assets/ex7_7.png" alt="executing terraform apply for cloud foundry space creation">

You can also check that everything is in place via the SAP BTP cockpit. You should see the Cloud Foundry space in the subaccount:

## Summary

You've now successfully created a Cloud Foundry environment instance as well as a Cloud Foundry space in SAP BTP.
