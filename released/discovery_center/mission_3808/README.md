# SAP Discovery Center mission - Onboarding & First Steps to SAP Cloud ALM

## Overview

This terraform script shows how to set up the SAP Discovery Center Mission - [Onboarding & First Steps to SAP Cloud ALM](https://discovery-center.cloud.sap/protected/index.html#/missiondetail/3808/3857)

## Content of setup

The setup comprises the following resources:

- Creation of the SAP BTP subaccount
- Entitlements of services
- Subscriptions to applications
- Role collection assignments to users

## Deploying the resources

Make sure that you are familiar with SAP BTP and know both the [Get Started with btp-terraform-samples](https://github.com/SAP-samples/btp-terraform-samples/blob/main/GET_STARTED.md) and the [Get Started with the Terraform Provider for BTP](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/btp-terraform-get-started.html)

To deploy the resources you must:

1. Set your credentials as environment variables
   
   ```bash
   export BTP_USERNAME ='<Email address of your BTP user>'
   export BTP_PASSWORD ='<Password of your BTP user>'
   export CF_USER ='<Email address of your BTP user>'
   export BTP_PASSWORD ='<Password of your BTP user>'   
   ```

2. Change the variables in the `sample.tfvars` file to meet your requirements

   > The minimal set of parameters you should specify (besides user_email and password) is global account (i.e. its subdomain) and the used custom_idp and all user assignments

   > âš  NOTE: You should pay attention **specifically** to the users defined in the samples.tfvars whether they already exist in your SAP BTP accounts. Otherwise, you might get error messages like, e.g., `Error: The user could not be found: jane.doe@test.com`.


3. Initialize your workspace:

   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```

4. You can check what Terraform plans to apply based on your configuration:

   ```bash
   terraform plan -var-file="sample.tfvars"
   ```

5. Apply your configuration to provision the resources:

   ```bash
   terraform apply -var-file="sample.tfvars"
   ```
