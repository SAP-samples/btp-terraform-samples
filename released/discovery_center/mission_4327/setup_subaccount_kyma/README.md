2. Navigate to `released/discovery_center/mission_4327/setup_subaccount_kyma`
3. You will be seeing these files named `main.tf`,`provider.tf`,`samples.tfvars`,`variables.tf`.
4. Create a file named terraform.tfvars and copy samples.tfvars content to terraform.tfvars. Update the variables to meet your requirements (By default free-tier plans are used, if you want to use it for production update in the terraform.tfvars accordingly) Follow these steps to use the script:
5. Set `BTP_USERNAME`,`BTP_PASSWORD`,`CF_USER` and `CF_PASSWORD` as ENV variables.

  export BTP_PASSWORD="<your password>"
  export CF_USER="<your email address>"
  export CF_PASSWORD="<your password>"
```

    terraform destroy
    ```

    Confirm the resource destruction by typing "yes."
