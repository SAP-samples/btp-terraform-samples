# Discovery Center Mission: Get Started with SAP Build Code and Joule using Generative AI (4441)

## Overview

This sample shows how to setup your SAP BTP account for the Discovery Center Mission - [Get Started with SAP Build Code and Joule using Generative AI](https://discovery-center.cloud.sap/missiondetail/4441/) for your trial account.

The respective setup of an Enterprise account is described in [SAP-samples/btp-terraform-samples/tree/main/released/discovery_center/mission_4441/README.md](https://github.com/SAP-samples/btp-terraform-samples/blob/main/released/discovery_center/mission_4441/full_setup_enterprise/step1/README.md)

## Important: Trial Account Prerequisites
Contrary to an Enterprise account (where the setup will happen in a newly created subaccount, where entitlements are added), we make the assumption that in your trial account there is already a subaccount (by default named 'trial') with all the required service entitlements and not already in use!

In a newly created trial account this is already true and you are good to go immediately with this setup. 

But if you have already used services and/or setup subscriptions in your trial account, you have to make sure that you free up these resources to start with this setup here (i.e. delete the corresponding services/subscriptions used for this Discover Center Mission setup). Otherwise the setup would fail!

For this mission setup the following resources (services, subscriptions, etc.) are used: 

- SAP Build Code (Subscription)

You could delete these resources in your [BTP Trial Cockpit](https://cockpit.btp.cloud.sap/trial) on the corresponding trial subaccount pages
- Services > Instances and Subscriptions

## Content of setup

The setup comprises the following resources:

- Entitlements of services
- Subscriptions to applications
- Role collection assignments to users


## Deploying the resources

Make sure that (1.) your trial account fulfills the above described important trial prerequisites and (2.) you are familiar with SAP BTP and know both the [Get Started with btp-terraform-samples](https://github.com/SAP-samples/btp-terraform-samples/blob/main/GET_STARTED.md) and the [Get Started with the Terraform Provider for BTP](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/btp-terraform-get-started.html)

To deploy the resources you must:

1. Set your credentials as environment variables
   
   ```bash
   export BTP_USERNAME ='<Email address of your BTP user>'
   export BTP_PASSWORD ='<Password of your BTP user>'
   ```

2. Change the variables in the `sample.tfvars` file to meet your requirements

   > The minimal set of parameters you should specify (besides user_email and password) is global account (i.e. its subdomain) and all user assignments

   > âš  NOTE: You should pay attention **specifically** to the users defined in the samples.tfvars whether they already exist in your SAP BTP accounts. Otherwise, you might get error messages like, e.g., `Error: The user could not be found: jane.doe@test.com`.


3. Initialize your workspace:

   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```

4. You can check what Terraform plans to apply based on your configuration:

   ```bash
   terraform plan -var-file="sample.tfvars"
   ```

5. Apply your configuration to provision the resources:

   ```bash
   terraform apply -var-file="sample.tfvars"
   ```

## In the end

You probably want to remove the assets after trying them out to avoid unnecessary costs. To do so execute the following command:

```bash
terraform destroy -var-file="sample.tfvars"
```
