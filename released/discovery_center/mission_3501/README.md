# Discovery Center Mission: Enhance core ERP business processes with resilient applications on SAP BTP (3501)

## Overview

This sample shows how to create a landscape for the Discovery Center Mission - [Enhance core ERP business processes with resilient applications on SAP BTP](https://discovery-center.cloud.sap/missiondetail/3501/)

## Content of setup

The setup comprises the following resources:

- Creation of the SAP BTP subaccount
- Entitlements of services
- Subscriptions to applications
- Role collection assignments to users
- Creation of CF environments
- Management of users and roles on org and space level

## Deploying the resources

To deploy the resources you must:

1. Export environment variables BTP_USERNAME, BTP_PASSWORD, CF_USER, and CF_PASSWORD with your username and password for the custom IdP of your global account.

2. Change the variables in the `samples.tfvars` file in the main folder to meet your requirements

   > âš  NOTE: You should pay attention **specifically** to the users defined in the samples.tfvars whether they already exist in your SAP BTP accounts. Otherwise you might get error messages like e.g. `Error: The user could not be found: jane.doe@test.com`.

3. Execute the apply.sh script.

4. Verify e.g., in BTP cockpit that a new subaccount with a integration suite, SAP Business Application Studio, CF environment instance and a CF space have been created.

5. Clean up by running the destroy.sh script.
