# [Terraform Remote Backend Configuration](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/settings/backends/configuration)

In Terraform, a backend determines where the state data files are stored. This state data is crucial for tracking the resources managed by Terraform. For more complex configurations, it's common to use either HCP Terraform or a remote backend to enable collaboration among multiple users working on the same infrastructure.

## Available Backends

By default, Terraform uses a backend called local, which stores state as a local file on disk. Alternatively, you can configure one of the built-in backends described in this documentation.

These built-in backends serve different purposes, from acting as remote disks for state files to supporting state locking, which helps prevent conflicts and ensures consistency during operations. It's important to note that you cannot load additional backends as plugins; only the listed built-in backends are available.

### Local Backend: 
The default backend stores state as a local file on disk. It's suitable for single-user environments where collaboration is not required.

### Remote Backend:
This backend serves as a remote disk for state files, enabling collaboration among multiple users. It supports locking to prevent conflicts during operations.

### Kubernetes Backend:
The Kubernetes backend stores state in a Kubernetes secret and supports state locking using a Lease resource. It allows for secure and collaborative state management in Kubernetes environments
