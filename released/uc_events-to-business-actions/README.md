# Use case: Dynamically react to changing business events in your supply chain

This script is based on the [GitHub repository for the use case of Build Events-to-Business Actions Scenarios with SAP BTP and Microsoft Azure/AWS](https://github.com/SAP-samples/btp-events-to-business-actions-framework/tree/main).

It uses the [Terraform provider for SAP BTP](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/SAP/btp/latest/docs) to setup the necessary BTP infrastructure for that use case.
